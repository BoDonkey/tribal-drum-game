## Home Processing
As players develop their homes, they can establish permanent processing stations:

- **Living Garden**: Spring-aligned space for plant processing
- **Sun Chamber**: Summer-aligned space for heat and energy processing
- **Preservation Corner**: Autumn-aligned space for curing and stabilizing
- **Quiet Workshop**: Winter-aligned space for detailed, precise work

Home processing stations provide bonuses when the home's season aligns with the current world season.
