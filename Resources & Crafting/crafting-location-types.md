# Crafting Location Types

## Introduction
This document details the various locations where crafting occurs in the game world. Unlike traditional RPGs with static crafting tables, this game features dynamic, living crafting locations that respond to the seasons, world conditions, and player relationships. These locations are integrated into the environment and often have their own personalities or spirits associated with them.

## Natural Formation Workshops

### Living Tree Hollows
**Region:** Spring (primarily)

**Description:**  
Ancient trees with naturally formed hollow spaces that change shape to accommodate different crafting needs. The living wood responds to the player's intentions and the materials being worked.

**Unique Properties:**
- Tree adjusts its interior based on current crafting needs
- Enhanced crafting of plant-based materials (150% effectiveness)
- Can "remember" previous crafting projects
- Sometimes produces small amounts of sap that serves as a crafting catalyst

**Seasonal Changes:**
- Spring: Most active and responsive, interior glows with soft green light
- Summer: Produces special resins that enhance material bonding
- Autumn: Interior lined with golden leaves that preserve harvested materials
- Winter: Enters semi-dormant state, but provides excellent insulation for delicate crafting

**Interaction Method:**
Players can "speak" to the tree through simple drum patterns or by offering small amounts of seasonal essences. The more often a player uses the same tree hollow, the more it adapts to their crafting style.

### Heat Vents
**Region:** Summer (primarily)

**Description:**  
Natural formations where sunlight concentrates or geothermal heat rises, creating perfect conditions for heat-based crafting. Often surrounded by uniquely adapted plants and heat-loving spirits.

**Unique Properties:**
- Variable heat levels that can be adjusted by repositioning materials
- Perfect for hardening, fusing, or transforming materials
- Occasionally produces rare heat crystals during intense sunlight
- Enhanced crafting of sun-charged and heat-requiring items (150% effectiveness)

**Seasonal Changes:**
- Spring: Milder heat, good for gentle drying or setting dyes
- Summer: Peak power, capable of the most challenging heat crafting
- Autumn: Heat fluctuates rhythmically, useful for tempering processes
- Winter: Minimal heat, but creates unique contrast conditions when cold materials meet warmth

**Interaction Method:**
Players use reflective tools to direct and focus the heat with precision. Offerings of summer materials can temporarily increase heat intensity or stability.

### Transformative Pools
**Region:** Autumn (primarily)

**Description:**  
Shallow, still pools with water that has unusual transmutative properties. Items placed within slowly change, combining properties or transitioning between states. Often surrounded by transformation-themed carvings or naturally occurring patterns.

**Unique Properties:**
- Materials left in the pools gradually combine properties
- Enhanced creation of hybrid or transitional items (150% effectiveness)
- Occasionally reveals hidden properties of materials
- Waters can be collected in small amounts for use in other crafting locations

**Seasonal Changes:**
- Spring: Waters promote growth and renewal aspects of transformation
- Summer: Waters accelerate transformation but may cause volatility
- Autumn: Perfect balance, transformations are stable and predictable
- Winter: Waters slow almost to stillness, allowing for extremely precise, gradual changes

**Interaction Method:**
Players can influence the transformation by adding small amounts of essences to the water or by playing specific drum rhythms that cause ripple patterns on the surface.

### Ice Acoustics Caves
**Region:** Winter (primarily)

**Description:**  
Naturally formed ice caves where sound behaves in unusual ways, creating perfect conditions for crafting items with resonant or harmonic properties. Ice formations grow in crystalline patterns that respond to sound.

**Unique Properties:**
- Sound sustains and amplifies, allowing for sonic shaping of materials
- Enhanced crafting of musical, communication, or spirit-connected items (150% effectiveness)
- Ice surfaces can "record" and play back sounds used during crafting
- Perfect for crystallization processes and precision work

**Seasonal Changes:**
- Spring: Ice begins to melt creating water droplet percussion elements
- Summer: Partially melted, creates unique reverberations harder to control but with unexpected results
- Autumn: Begins refreezing, allowing for preservation of sound patterns
- Winter: Perfect acoustic conditions, maximum precision and control

**Interaction Method:**
Players use voice, drums, or special resonant tools to create sound patterns that shape materials. Different pitches and rhythms produce different effects on various materials.

## Spirit-Assisted Workshops

### veridian Gathering Circles
**Region:** All regions (different veridian types)

**Description:**  
Natural clearings where veridian spirits (nature guardians) regularly gather. When properly invited, these spirits will assist in crafting by lending their innate abilities to the process. Each seasonal region has different types of veridian with unique crafting specialties.

**Unique Properties:**
- veridian can manipulate materials in ways impossible for players alone
- Enhanced crafting based on the type of veridian present (varies by region)
