# Enhancement Methods: Taking Items to the Next Level

## Introduction
This document outlines techniques for enhancing basic crafted items to create more powerful, specialized, or personalized versions. Enhancement is distinct from initial crafting, focused on improving existing items rather than creating new ones. These methods offer progression paths for players to grow with their favorite items throughout their journey.
