## World Season Influence

The current world season affects all resources in the following ways:

| World Season | Effect on Resources |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Spring** | Spring resources at peak potency (150%); Winter resources weakened (75%); others normal |
| **Summer** | Summer resources at peak potency (150%); Spring resources slightly enhanced (110%); Autumn resources slightly weakened (90%); Winter resources weakened (75%) |
| **Autumn** | Autumn resources at peak potency (150%); Summer resources slightly enhanced (110%); Winter resources slightly weakened (90%); Spring resources weakened (75%) |
