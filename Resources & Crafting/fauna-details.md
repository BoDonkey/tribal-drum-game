# Fauna-Derived Materials: Ethical Gathering & Processing

## Introduction

This document details the specialized techniques, tools, and methods for ethically gathering and processing materials from the animal world throughout the seasonal regions. Unlike traditional hunting or trapping, all fauna-derived resources in this world are collected without harm to animals, focusing exclusively on naturally shed, discarded, or freely given materials. This approach honors the harmonious relationship between guardians and the animal kingdom while providing essential crafting resources with unique properties.

*Note: All materials described in this document are ethically gathered without harm to animals. No animals are killed or captured for their resources.*

## Ethical Gathering Principles

### Core Values

- Only collect materials naturally shed or discarded by animals
- Never pursue or disturb animals for their materials
- Leave sufficient materials in the environment for other creatures' needs
- Express gratitude through offerings or drum rhythms
- Recognize each material as a gift, not a resource to be exploited

### Reciprocity Practices

| Practice | Description | Benefit to Animals | Benefit to Guardian |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Essence Offering** | Leaving small amount of seasonal essence where materials are found | Enriches habitat with harmonious energy | Strengthens future materials from the area |
| **Habitat Enhancement** | Creating or improving appropriate shelters | Provides better protection for animals | Increases likelihood of finding quality materials |
| **Food Provision** | Leaving appropriate seasonal foods | Supports animal health during scarce times | Encourages animals to frequent the area |
| **Protection Drumming** | Playing rhythms that warn of nearby dangers | Alerts animals to potential threats | Builds trust with local fauna |
| **Migration Assistance** | Clearing paths during seasonal transitions | Eases seasonal movement for animals | Creates reliable gathering routes for seasonal materials |

## Ethical Considerations & Practices

### Gathering Guidelines

- Never gather materials from living animals without their clear offering
- Leave at least 70% of any found materials for use by other creatures
- Avoid gathering in the same location more than once per season
- Use companion insight to determine appropriate gathering times
- Express gratitude through essence offerings or appropriate drum rhythms

### Cultural Respect

- Acknowledge the traditional Saami practices that inspire these methods
- Respect regional variations in animal relationships and gathering techniques
- Learn from local knowledge and adapt approaches accordingly
- Share discoveries and successful techniques with other guardians
- Honor the spiritual connection between animals, guardians, and the land

### Sustainability Practices

- Maintain detailed records of gathering locations and quantities
- Actively contribute to habitat enhancement in gathering areas
- Rotate gathering routes to prevent overuse of any area
- Participate in seasonal ceremonies that honor animal contributions
- Return processed materials to the cycle when their use is complete

## Implementation Notes

### Gameplay Integration

- Fauna gathering should feel like a discovery process, not resource hunting
- Visual indicators (subtle glimmers, gentle movements) show gathering opportunities
- Companions provide guidance toward ethical gathering opportunities
- Animals visibly respond to proper approach and gratitude (returning to areas, leaving more materials)
- Processing animations reflect careful, respectful handling of animal-derived materials

### Teaching Methods

- Initial gathering taught through companion guidance
- Processing techniques introduced through dreams and gentle discovery
- Advanced combinations learned from veridian spirits and experienced guardians
- Journal automatically records ethically gathered materials and their properties
- Seasonal ceremonies reveal special gathering opportunities
