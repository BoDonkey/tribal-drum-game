# Character Creation & Origin Story

## Overview

This character creation sequence serves multiple purposes:
1. Allow players to personalize their character
2. Introduce the world's lore and the Fifth Season threat
3. Foreshadow the player's journey and companions
4. Teach basic gameplay mechanics through narrative integration

The sequence unfolds as a vision/dream that transitions into the Seasonal Calling ceremony, where the player makes their choices while learning about the world.

## Opening Sequence: The Dream Vision

*The game begins with a black screen and gentle ambient sounds. Soft drum beats gradually emerge.*

### Voiceover (Elder Noaidi)
> *"In the beginning, there were four seasons, in perfect harmony. Each with their gift, each with their time."*

*The screen slowly fades in to show swirling aurora-like lights in four colors: green (Spring), golden (Summer), red-orange (Autumn), and blue (Winter).*

> *"Spring brought renewal, Summer brought growth, Autumn brought wisdom, Winter brought rest. The cycle continued, unbroken, watched over by the haldi spirits and their animal guardians."*

*The lights form into four spirit animals that circle each other: a reindeer (Bloom), a fox (Ember), an owl (Wispy), and a wolf (Frost).*

> *"But now, a Fifth Season emerges—not of harmony, but of chaos. The boundaries between seasons blur. The haldi retreat. The world cries out for one who can restore balance."*

*The harmonious scene is disrupted as gray, shifting tendrils intrude from the edges, causing the spirit animals to scatter and the colors to dim.*

> *"The signs have led us to you, young one. Tonight, you will be called. Tonight, you will begin your journey."*

*The screen transitions to the player character sleeping in a simple dwelling. They wake suddenly as a beam of moonlight illuminates the room.*

## Character Customization: Preparing for the Ceremony

*The player now has control of their character for the first time. An elder noaidi (shaman) waits outside the dwelling.*

### Elder Noaidi Dialog
"The calling ceremony will begin soon. But first, you must prepare yourself."

#### Tutorial Prompt
`Use the movement controls to explore your dwelling and prepare for the ceremony.`

*The dwelling has interactive elements that allow the player to customize their appearance:*

1. **Mirror:** Customize face, hair, and basic physical features
2. **Clothing Chest:** Choose initial outfit style (while keeping seasonal customization for later)
3. **Personal Items:** Select a personal item that hints at background (options below)

#### Personal Item Selection
*Each item suggests a background and grants a small starting bonus*

| Item | Implied Background | Starting Bonus |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Worn Journal** | Scholar/Observer | +Small knowledge of flora and fauna |
| **Simple Drum** | Musician/Apprentice | +Basic drumming rhythm already known |
| **Carved Pendant** | Artisan/Crafter | +Basic crafting recipe already known |
| **Small Knife** | Explorer/Gatherer | +Ability to gather special resources |

*After the player has finished customizing, the elder noaidi speaks again:*

"It is time. The spirits await you at the Sacred Circle. Follow me."

---

## The Seasonal Calling Ceremony

*The player follows the elder to a stone circle illuminated by four ceremonial fires—each burning with a different colored flame representing a season. Other villagers are gathered around, drumming softly.*

### Elder Noaidi
"Step into the circle. Feel the seasons. Listen to their call. One will speak to your spirit more strongly than the others."

*The player can now move freely between the four fires. As they approach each one, they experience a vision and hear the voice of that season.*

#### Spring Fire (Green Flames)

*When approached, spring flowers bloom around the fire, and a translucent reindeer form appears briefly.*

**Spring Voice:**
> "I am the season of beginnings, of gentle awakening and new growth. My power is that of healing and renewal. Those who hear my call see potential where others see barrenness. They nurture what is fragile until it stands strong."

> "I am the season of fullness, of vibrant energy and boundless light. My power is that of vitality and transformation. Those who hear my call bring warmth to the coldest places. They find paths where others see only obstacles."

#### Autumn Fire (Red-Orange Flames)

> "I am the season of harvest, of reflection and preserving wisdom. My power is that of memory and transformation. Those who hear my call see patterns where others see chaos. They remember what others forget."

**Gameplay Preview:**

## The Choosing and The Vision

*Once the player selects a season by approaching its fire and confirming their choice, the ceremony continues.*

### Elder Noaidi
"The [selected season] speaks through you. Its strength will be your strength. But remember, true harmony requires understanding of all seasons."

*The player's clothing subtly changes to incorporate elements of their chosen season. The corresponding spirit animal approaches from the darkness and stands beside them.*

### Elder Noaidi
"Your first guide has found you. Together, you will seek out the others."

*Suddenly, all four fires flare intensely, and the player experiences a shared vision with all ceremony participants:*

---

## The Prophecy Vision

*The vision shows a swirling gray mist—the Fifth Season—spreading across a map of the world, obscuring the distinct seasonal regions.*

### Voiceover (All Four Season Voices in Harmony)
> "The balance fractures. The Fifth Season grows. Neither creation nor destruction, but unmaking—the unraveling of bonds that hold the world together."

*Four lights appear in the mist—green, gold, orange, and blue—each struggling to shine through.*

> "Four must become one. Four seasons. Four spirits. Four hearts beating as one."

*The vision shifts to show the Sacred Grove at the center of the world, where the four regions meet. It's being consumed by the gray mist.*

> "Find the Ancient Hearth. Learn the Harmony Rhythm. Gather what has been scattered."

*Brief, fragmented images flash rapidly:*
- A drum made from materials of all seasons
- The four spirit animals standing at cardinal points around a central fire
- A tree with leaves of all four seasons growing from a single trunk
- A crystalline object shattered into four pieces

> "When chaos seems strongest, look to what has always been. The pattern exists within the discord. The Fifth Season is not your enemy, but your final teacher."

*The vision fades, returning to the ceremony.*

---

## Ceremony Conclusion

*The player finds themselves back in the ceremonial circle, their chosen companion animal still beside them. The gathered villagers look at them with a mixture of hope and concern.*

### Elder Noaidi
"You have been shown what may come to pass. The path will not be easy, but you will not walk it alone."

*The elder hands the player a simple drum.*

"This is your first tool on your journey. Its voice will grow stronger as you do. Listen to the land, learn its rhythms, and harmony will follow."

#### Tutorial Prompt
`Press [button] to accept the drum and learn your first rhythm pattern.`

*A simple mini-game introduces the basic drumming mechanic, teaching the pattern associated with the player's chosen season.*

### Elder Noaidi
"Tomorrow, you begin your journey. Rest now, for the path ahead is long."

*The screen fades to black, ending the character creation sequence and transitioning to the start of gameplay.*

## Implementation Notes

### Character Data Storage

After completion, the following information should be saved to the player profile:

```gdscript
var player_data = {
    "appearance": {
        # Physical customization options selected
    },
    "seasonal_affinity": "Spring", # Or Summer, Autumn, Winter
    "starting_item": "worn_journal", # Based on selection
    "first_companion": "bloom", # Based on seasonal affinity
    "starting_skill": "growth_rhythm", # Based on seasonal affinity
    "bonus_attribute": "resonance" # Based on seasonal affinity
}
```

### Transitional Tutorial Elements

The character creation sequence naturally introduces:
1. Basic movement controls
2. Interaction with objects
3. Dialog system
4. Companion presence
5. Drumming mechanics

### Accessibility Options

- All voiceover content should be available as readable text
- Allow players to skip the ceremony and select options directly if desired
- Provide options to revisit the prophecy vision later in the game

### Foreshadowing Elements

The prophecy vision deliberately includes elements that will become important later:
1. The Ancient Hearth (final quest location)
2. The Harmony Rhythm (key to resolving the Fifth Season)
3. The Harmony Drum (crafted from all-season materials)
4. The suggestion that the Fifth Season must be integrated, not destroyed

## Narrative Integration with Game Systems

This character creation sequence establishes several core game concepts:

### 1. Seasonal Affinity System
- Player's choice influences their starting location and abilities
- Creates natural progression of discovering other seasonal regions
- Establishes bond with first companion

### 2. Central Conflict
- Introduces the Fifth Season as an imbalance, not a traditional villain
- Establishes restoration rather than destruction as the goal
- Foreshadows the need to understand chaos rather than simply oppose it

### 3. Companion System
- Introduces all four companions visually
- Establishes the importance of forming bonds with all seasons
- Creates immediate connection with first companion

### 4. Drumming Mechanic
- Contextualizes rhythm patterns as ancient knowledge
- Connects drumming to spiritual communication
- Introduces basic pattern matching in a narrative context

### 5. World Structure
- Establishes the four distinct seasonal regions
- Introduces the concept of the central Sacred Grove
- Hints at the presence of sacred sites (Ancient Hearth)

This narrative framework provides players with immediate purpose while establishing the foundational lore of the game world.
