Finally, here's how to integrate this world generator with your existing project:

Create a new scene with a Node3D as the root and name it "World"
Attach the world_generator.gd script to this node
Create necessary child nodes:

Node3D for organizing regions
Node3D for organizing resources
Node3D for organizing crafting locations


In your main scene:

Add your Player scene
Add the World scene
Set up basic camera and lighting



To implement the Input Map for the new interactions:

Go to Project → Project Settings → Input Map
Add a new action called "interact"
Assign the F key to it

This implementation gives you:

A procedurally generated world with distinct seasonal regions
Resource generation based on region type
Crafting location placement
Wayfinding pedestal system for fast travel
Player interaction with resources and objects

The world generator is built to be modular, so you can easily expand it by:

Adding more resource types
Creating more varied crafting locations
Implementing the full restoration puzzle for pedestals
Adding seasonal effects and weather systems
Implementing companions that help with resource detection
