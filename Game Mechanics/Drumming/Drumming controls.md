1. **Triggers (LT/RT) as Intensity Controls**:

   * LT could represent softer beats  
   * RT could represent stronger beats  
   * Partial pulls could create medium intensities  
   * This would add depth without complexity  
2. **Bumpers (LB/RB) as Drum Modifiers**:

   * LB could add a "resonance" effect to the next beat  
   * RB could add a "sustain" effect to hold a sound  
   * Using them in combination with face buttons creates special sounds  
3. **Visual Implementation**:

   * Bumpers could be represented at the top corners of the screen with subtle icons  
   * Triggers could be shown as graduated bars on the sides  
   * Color coding could help distinguish their functions

For the Memory Dust mechanic with a controller:

* Left stick could control the direction/aim of the dust  
* Right trigger could control the amount/intensity of dust applied  
* A subtle particle effect could show the dust's area of effect

To keep it casual-friendly, there will be a "basic mode" that only uses the face buttons for essential patterns, while allowing more experienced players to incorporate the triggers and bumpers for advanced techniques and special effects.
