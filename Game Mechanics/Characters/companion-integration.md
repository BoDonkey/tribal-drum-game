# Companion Integration: How Companions Assist in Gathering and Crafting

## Introduction
This document details how animal companions integrate with the game's gathering and crafting systems. Rather than passive followers, companions are active participants in resource collection, crafting processes, and item enhancement. The companion system emphasizes relationship building, with benefits that grow as bonds strengthen between player and companions.
