# Saami-Inspired Seasonal Game: Design & Implementation Plan

## Game Overview

**Game Concept:** A non-violent, exploration-driven adventure game inspired by Saami mythology, centered around the harmony of seasons, companionship with animals, and the restoration of balance to a world threatened by a chaotic Fifth Season.

**Core Themes:** 
- Seasonal harmony and cycles
- Cooperative relationship with nature and spirits
- Restoration rather than destruction
- Personal growth through crafting and exploration

**Target Audience:** Players of various ages who enjoy relaxing "comfort" games with depth, creative crafting systems, and meaningful exploration without combat stress.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Minute-to-Minute Gameplay
1. **Explore** seasonal environments with animal companions
2. **Gather** resources specific to each season and region
3. **Craft** items, tools, and spiritual objects
4. **Perform** rituals using the noaidi drumming system
5. **Restore** harmony to areas affected by the Fifth Season
6. **Build** relationships with companions and spirits

### Session Flow
1. Player sets a goal for their session (quest, crafting project, exploration)
2. Travels to appropriate region with chosen companion
3. Gathers necessary resources while discovering new locations
4. Returns to a home base or crafting location to process materials
5. Creates items or performs rituals to progress their goal
6. Ends session with meaningful progress and new discoveries

### Progression Mechanics
- Restore seasonal regions to unlock new areas
- Strengthen bonds with companions to gain new abilities
- Discover crafting recipes through exploration and spirit interactions
- Learn new drum patterns to perform more complex rituals
- Develop seasonal homes with specialized crafting stations

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Technical Challenges

1. **Complex Companion AI**
   - **Solution**: Start with simple follow behavior, incrementally add detection and assistance features
   - **Fallback**: Use "summon" mechanic if pathfinding proves difficult

2. **Drumming Input Recognition**
   - **Solution**: Begin with pattern-matching before implementing freestyle system
   - **Fallback**: Simplify to contextual button combinations if needed

3. **Seasonal Transitions**
   - **Solution**: Use shader effects for visual transitions, develop region loading system
   - **Fallback**: Use distinct separated regions with clear boundaries

4. **Resource Respawning System**
   - **Solution**: Global timer with local instance management
   - **Fallback**: Simplified respawn on region reload

### Design Challenges

1. **Difficulty Balance for Different Ages**
   - **Solution**: Optional guidance system, adjustable difficulty settings
   - **Approach**: Core progression simple, optional challenges for depth

2. **Keeping Non-Combat Gameplay Engaging**
   - **Solution**: Focus on discovery and transformation, satisfying feedback loops
   - **Approach**: Visible world changes from player actions, rich sensory feedback

3. **Tutorial Integration**
   - **Solution**: Learn-by-doing approach, companion guidance
   - **Approach**: Contextual tips, optional deeper explanations
