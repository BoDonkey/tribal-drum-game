# tribal-drum-game
A build-in-public game using the Godot engine

## About the Project

This is an open development video game project being built in public. The game is currently in its early stages, and contributions are welcome! It will be released as pay-what-you-want software.

The game is being developed in my free time without current external support, with a focus on engaging lore, mechanics, and community-driven improvements. By sharing progress in this repository, I hope to attract like-minded contributors who are interested in game development.

## Documentation

This project includes a collection of markdown files that document the game's design, lore, mechanics, and development progress. You can browse these files directly on GitHub, or generate a local HTML website for easier navigation.

### Generating the Documentation Website

To create a local HTML version of all documentation:

1. Ensure you have [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed on your system
2. Run the documentation generator script:
   ```bash
   ./generate_site.sh
   ```
3. Open `site/index.html` in your web browser to browse the documentation

The script will process all markdown files, including those in subdirectories, and create a linked website structure for easier navigation.

### How to Get Involved

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- World-building and lore
- Game mechanics design
- Code development (engine, scripting, AI, etc.)
- Art and assets (sprites, concept art, UI elements)
- Playtesting and feedback

If you'd like to contribute, check the Roadmap and Issues for open tasks.

## Development

More information about development setup and processes will be added as the project progresses.
